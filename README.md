# Technical Writing Experience

I have extensive experience writing technical blog posts in the AI and ML space. I've written for multiple clients over the last few years. You can see pages of 5-star reviews on my [Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01153ca9fd0099730e).

The two types of articles I have the most experience with are:
1. Code Tutorials (+ video walkthroughs)
2. Technical Content for Businesses

I am not well-versed in highly formal or non-technical business content. 

I excel at easy-to-read technical content that ranks, builds your audience and sells your services.

I provided the words, code and video. The client supplied the styling. You can see the videos on the published pages below. They are screencast videos without my face and were recorded in one-take.
