# Technical Writing Experience

I have extensive experience writing technical blog posts in the AI and ML space. I've written for multiple clients over the last few years. You can see pages of 5-star reviews on my [Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01153ca9fd0099730e).

The two types of articles I have the most experience with are:
1. Code Tutorials (+ video walkthroughs)
2. Technical Content for Businesses

I am not well-versed in highly formal or non-technical business content. 

I excel at easy-to-read technical content that ranks, builds your audience, and sells your services. 

# Matplotlib Code Tutorial Articles (+ Videos) - Written in Jupyter

This repo contains a collection of technical code tutorial articles I wrote for [Finxter.com](https://blog.finxter.com/) - a leading Python blog. Each was a paid project on Upwork and all resulted in ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ reviews such as this one:

I provided the words, code, and video. The client supplied the styling. Click below to see the videos. They are screencast videos without my face and were recorded in one take.

I wrote each article in Jupyter, then used the [nb2wp](https://github.com/bennylp/nb2wp) library to convert the notebook to Wordpress.com HTML. Finally, I uploaded the final version to WordPress.

# Business-Focused Articles

Since April 2020, I've been writing for [Panoply.io](https://panoply.io/) - a data warehousing company based in the US. I've written about various topics, including ETL, BI tools, and cloud-native data warehousing solutions.

The client provided a brief for each article that outlined the title, the main points the article should hit, and the keywords to target. I've found that getting on the same page like this before starting writing is the foundation for a long and fruitful writing partnership. I thoroughly enjoy writing for Panoply and hope future clients can meet their standards of preparation.

Here is the review Panoply left me the first time we worked together.
