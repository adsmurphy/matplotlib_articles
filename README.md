# Technical Writing Experience

I have extensive experience writing technical blog posts in the AI and ML space. I've written for multiple clients over the last few years. You can see pages of 5-star reviews on my [Upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01153ca9fd0099730e).

The two types of articles I have the most experience with are:
1. Code Tutorial
2. Technical Content for Businesses

I am not well-versed in highly formal or non-technical business content. I excel at easy-to-read technical content that ranks, builds your audience and sells your services.
